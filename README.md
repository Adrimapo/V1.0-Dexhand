From my final grade project, [Programming drones with imitation learning and neural networks](https://github.com/RoboticsLabURJC/2023-tfg-adrian-madinabeitia), the idea arose to combine this concept with the field of prosthetics. The Dexhand model created by was found, which I found quite interesting for this project.

## 3D printing

The original design was tested for high speed printing using a 0.6mm diameter nozzle and 0.4mm layer thickness except for the tendon spools which benefit from printing at 0.3mm layer thickness or better.
