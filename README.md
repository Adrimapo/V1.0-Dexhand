# Dexhand

Made entirely by 3dprinting with additional total cost of components required for the hand starting at around $300 USD.

The #cad for the arm and hand is freely and publically available down to a parasolid level at:

https://cad.onshape.com/documents/16c809d35214bd31c5b0324f/w/56b2fb82f7bdce505771766f/e/df78e66574dc7dbd45e4826c?renderMode=0&uiState=6358f3f91587a72417a28b1c

The forearm and hand can operate as a stand-alone unit allowing unlimited axial rotation for rotational tasks like scrubbing.

Some notes on printing:

Designed and tested for high speed printing using a 0.6mm diameter nozzle and 0.4mm layer thickness except for the tendon spools (three type of Tendon_Spool_01 supplied, ymmv) and tendon hanger which benefit from printing at 0.3mm layer thickness or better.

Test printed in CF nylon with 0.6mm nozzle and 0.4mm layer for structural components. 

To finish 3d prints to a high standard requires a fine sandpaper or emery board.

Diamond coated steel nail files are a handy tool: https://amzn.to/3VBBsOX

Though my favourite diamond file is actually intended for maintaining whetstones, just a nice big expanse of diamond to use :-)

Additional components required are listed below.

Please consider buying via the Amazon links where available to help fund the robot development.

The biggest cost item are the servos:

16 slim microservos like the Emax ES3301 (approx $6.6) are needed for a total of approx 100 - 200 bucks.

The hand in the video uses Emax ES3302 but any slim micro servo that fits inside the envelope of 23.2*9.2*24.1 will do.

Emax themselves make four variants at this size with plastic or metal gears and using either digital or analog control technology.

ES3301 (approx $6.6)
ES3302 (approx $9.2)
ES3351  (approx $8.5)
ES3352 (approx $12)

2 micro servos needed for wrist flexion and extension (required).

Feetech SCS2332 - https://feetechrc.com/product-name_55... are recommended.

These are serial bus driven servos over allowing a greater range of controlled rotation.

They cost around 35 bucks each plus delivery obvs.

If you prefer to use a traditional servo for simplicity they can be substituted by any servo that fits inside the envelope 23.2*12.1*28.5mm.

The trade off is the reduction of the powered range of motion of the wrist to about half.

1 standard servo needed for axial wrist rotation (optional)
Feetech SCS15 - https://feetechrc.com/6v-15kg-digital... or any servo that fits inside the envelope 40*20*40.5mm. Reduces powered range of motion to about half and the loss of a continuous rotation option.

The rest of the components are relatively inexpensive:
